## 📝 TaskHub

**TaskHub** is a simple yet powerful task management app built with Flask (Python) on the backend and React (JavaScript) on the frontend. The goal is to provide users with a clean, intuitive interface for organizing their tasks — whether it's for personal productivity or team collaboration.

### 🚀 Why TaskHub?

I created TaskHub as a hands-on project to explore building a full-stack web app with separate backend and frontend setups. The idea was to create a user-friendly tool that can handle task creation, updates, and completion tracking — while keeping the codebase modular, maintainable, and scalable.

### 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Frontend:** React, Axios
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (optional)

* Create, read, update, and delete tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Simple UI with responsive layout
* PostgreSQL integration via SQLAlchemy ORM
